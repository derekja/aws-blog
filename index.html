                        Summertime is internship season at UVic! Our students go off to various companies, and they also work on joint research projects. One of the projects that we are working on is with a non-profit called the <a href="https://coastalcomputing.ca/" target="_blank">Pacific Coastal Computing Association</a> who is developing an application called <a href="https://knowledgegraph.ca/" target="_blank">KnowledgeGraph</a> to use AI to assist in educational efforts, both at UVic and other institutions, and in consultation with community efforts.
                    </p>

                        This work is also highly leveraging AWS infrastructure. Nathan Inbar is a UVic student that spent most of his summer wrangling various AWS services - EC2, S3, Application Gateway, Bedrock, ECR/ECS, etc - to create a cloud native version of KnowledgeGraph.

                        The team is using Claude Code as our AI tool of choice, and it helps to have some structure around the use of the tool to keep consistency. Even the markdown files give us a good idea of self-documenting features of using the AI tools, but the real benefit comes from allowing them to tune our working environment. We use the AI tools to plan development features, to start the development process, to do code reviews and test case development. One thing we do NOT do is vibe code. Every developer on the team is responsible for fully understanding and approving every line of code that goes into the product. How much of the code is automatically generated varies both by team member and application area.
                    </p>

                    <p>
                        Although we haven't made this shift yet, we are evaluating a tool that has just come out from Github called <a href="https://github.com/github/spec-kit" target="_blank">spec-kit</a>. As we move towards a new phase of the project in the fall we are investigating spec-kit as an AI coding model to move towards.

                    <p>
                        The other work presently going on is to tie the AWS services into a Terraform based setup. This is one of the areas that is always a barrier to new people on the AWS platform - understanding the wealth of services and using the web console to set them up is just a very complex learning process. The use of Terraform allows us to use an Infrastructure as Code (IaC) approach to deployment that is really important in creating repeatable installations on AWS.

                        In one exciting development, one of our team members has been asked to speak at a major Git conference at the end of the month! Congratulations Piyush in this fun opportunity!

                        Mid-August of 2025, a group of UVic students participated in SIGGRAPH's <a href="https://s2025.siggraph.org/event/appy-hour/" target="_blank">Appy Hour</a>. They were demonstrating several applications that we built using Amazon Web Services to underlie the AI applications that we chose to engage audiences with. These were examples of the type of application that can support museum installations.
                    </p>

                    <p>
                        In the first example, Annie McClure built a web page and a series of speech interactive applications. She was experimenting with AI authoring tools and her first task was to figure out how to get Claude Code to work with the Anthropic models on AWS Bedrock! Fortunately, there were some guides to lead her way (<a href="https://builder.aws.com/content/2tXkZKrZzlrlu0KfH8gST5Dkppq/claude-code-on-amazon-bedrock-quick-setup-guide" target="_blank">Claude Code on Amazon Bedrock Quick Setup Guide</a>).
                    </p>

                    </div>

                    <p>
                        Her next task was to have Claude help her develop some web pages. A theme of the exhibit was diatoms - microscopic ocean creatures that serve an important role in ecosystem signalling. There were also two other example applications that she worked on.
                    </p>

                    </div>

                    <p>
                        These web pages were backed up by a voice interactive system that operates over the phone lines. Please call it yourself! Dr. Marino Waters (an AI) can be reached at <strong>778-817-1483</strong>.
                    </p>

                    <p>
                        Annie worked out illustrative prompts for that system, which is based on the <a href="https://aws.amazon.com/blogs/aws/introducing-amazon-nova-sonic-human-like-voice-conversations-for-generative-ai-applications/" target="_blank">AWS Nova Sonic speech to speech model</a> and allows the system to provide snappy responses that mimic human-to-human conversations. These were tied in to the telephone network through a Voice over IP service (voip.ms) and the AWS Connect service.

                    <p>
                        Another student, Nathan Inbar, did work to get a demonstration of the diatom application to run on the <a href="https://pro.sony/en_CA/products/spatial-reality-displays/3d-professional-images" target="_blank">Sony SRD monitor</a> which Sony loaned to us to try developing some applications on.

                    <p>
                        Nathan and Hongyu Wan handled the crowds at SIGGRAPH with aplomb, answering questions and demonstrating the applications. Hongyu was the primary author of the Unity-based game segment that was shown to engage visitors with the world of diatoms. Here is a video of that application!
