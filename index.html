                        Teaching distributed systems in university courses requires robust cloud environments that can accommodate complex student projects while maintaining cost control and administrative efficiency. This post explores how AWS Innovation Sandbox offers advantages over traditional AWS Learner Lab environments for academic distributed systems coursework.
                    </p>

                    <h2>Context & Challenges with AWS Learner Lab</h2>
                    <p>
                        To learn fundamental knowledge of distributed systems, courses guide students to deploy, interact, and test their services in AWS environments. AWS Academy's Learner Lab platform simplifies the workflow by providing federated accounts with fixed budgets and custom duration, but comes with significant limitations:
                    </p>

                    <ul>
                        <li><strong>Budget Cap Restrictions:</strong> The $50 budget limit often proves insufficient for comprehensive distributed systems projects</li>
                        <li><strong>Limited Service Access:</strong> Restricted range of AWS services available, limiting the scope of learning materials</li>
                        <li><strong>IAM Limitations:</strong> Strict prohibition of user and role creation through the existing "LabRole", preventing realistic cloud architecture learning</li>
                        <li><strong>Account Termination:</strong> Accounts are directly terminated when credits expire, forcing students to rebuild services</li>
                        <li><strong>Limited Visibility:</strong> Restricted access to billing and cost pages makes it difficult for students to track usage</li>
                    </ul>

                    <p>
                        The restricted IAM access becomes problematic when incorporating advanced projects that require services beyond the approved list. In a recent distributed systems course with 30 students, more than a third required new account requests during the semester, creating significant administrative burden for both instructors and students.
                    </p>

                    <h2>AWS Innovation Sandbox: A Comprehensive Solution</h2>
                    <p>
                        AWS Innovation Sandbox, designed specifically for use cases like higher education training labs, addresses many of these limitations by providing a more flexible and comprehensive educational environment.
                    </p>

                    <h3>Enhanced Account Management</h3>
                    <p>
                        Innovation Sandbox offers sophisticated account lifecycle management through AWS Organizations, reducing administrative overhead. Accounts can be configured with both time-limited (in hours) and cost-limited (in integer dollars) constraints, with global values set via AppConfig or local values through lease templates in the web UI.
                    </p>

                    <h3>Broader Service Access and Permissions</h3>
                    <p>
                        Unlike Learner Lab's restrictive service list, Innovation Sandbox provides access to a comprehensive range of AWS services. Students can work with advanced networking, container orchestration (ECS/ECR), and serverless computing services essential for modern distributed systems education.
                    </p>

                    <div class="image-container">
                        <img src="sandbox-permissions.png" alt="Innovation Sandbox permissions configuration showing ECS/ECR access options" />
                    </div>

                    <p>
                        However, the default user permissions may require adjustment for certain services. For advanced projects requiring ECS/ECR deployment, Service Control Policies (SCPs) in AWS Organizations may need modification to grant appropriate access.
                    </p>

                    <h3>Improved Cost Monitoring and Budgeting</h3>
                    <p>
                        The platform provides enhanced visibility into account usage through integrated budget tracking and cost monitoring tools. While the system includes an alert system for notifications, budget UI updates and Cost Explorer data may have some refresh delays.
                    </p>

                    <div class="image-container">
                        <img src="sandbox-budget-ui.png" alt="Innovation Sandbox budget monitoring interface" />
                    </div>

                    <div class="image-container">
                        <img src="sandbox-cost-explorer.png" alt="AWS Cost Explorer showing monthly usage tracking in Innovation Sandbox" />
                    </div>

                    <h3>Administrative Control and Flexibility</h3>
                    <p>
                        The admin account provides comprehensive control over account lifecycle management, including moving accounts between states (entry to cleanup, active to frozen), lease template management, and user access control through Identity Center integration. The platform supports three user levels: admin, manager, and user, each with appropriate permissions for their role.
                    </p>

                    <h2>Educational Impact and Use Cases</h2>
                    <p>
                        The enhanced capabilities of Innovation Sandbox enable more sophisticated distributed systems projects, including:
                    </p>

                    <ul>
                        <li>Multi-region deployments for studying latency and consistency</li>
                        <li>Auto-scaling scenarios for load testing and performance analysis</li>
                        <li>Complex microservices architectures with proper security boundaries</li>
                        <li>Container orchestration and observability systems</li>
                        <li>Hybrid cloud and edge computing scenarios</li>
                    </ul>

                    <p>
                        Projects like observability systems in distributed environments become feasible with the expanded service access and flexible permission model that Innovation Sandbox provides.
                    </p>

                    <h2>Implementation Considerations</h2>
                    <p>
                        While Innovation Sandbox offers significant advantages, educators should consider several factors:
                    </p>

                    <ul>
                        <li><strong>Setup Complexity:</strong> Initial configuration requires more planning than Learner Lab, with manual SAML 2.0 application creation steps that don't support automation</li>
                        <li><strong>Permission Configuration:</strong> Default user permissions may require customization for specific course requirements</li>
                        <li><strong>Monitoring Requirements:</strong> Enhanced capabilities require more sophisticated usage monitoring and cost management</li>
                        <li><strong>Student Onboarding:</strong> Students may need additional training on the expanded service portfolio</li>
                    </ul>

                    <h2>Technical Setup Process</h2>
                    <p>
                        The deployment follows a structured four-step process outlined in the official AWS documentation:
                    </p>
                    <ol>
                        <li>Deploy the AccountPool stack for account orchestration</li>
                        <li>Deploy the IDC (Identity Center) stack for authentication management</li>
                        <li>Deploy the Data stack for configuration and monitoring</li>
                        <li>Deploy the Compute stack for the web interface and processing</li>
                    </ol>

                    <p>
                        Note that production-level access for SES (Simple Email Service) can take up to 2 days if experimenting with new domains for notification systems.
                    </p>

                    <h2>Looking Forward</h2>
                    <p>
                        As distributed systems education evolves to meet industry demands, platforms like AWS Innovation Sandbox provide the flexibility and comprehensive service access needed to prepare students for real-world challenges. The ability to work with production-grade tools and realistic constraints better prepares graduates for careers in cloud-native distributed systems development.
                    </p>

                    <p>
                        For educators currently using AWS Learner Lab, Innovation Sandbox presents a compelling upgrade path that addresses many common limitations while providing the administrative control necessary for effective course management. The enhanced capabilities and reduced long-term administrative overhead make it an attractive solution for advanced distributed systems education.

                        Summertime is internship season at UVic! Our students go off to various companies, and they also work on joint research projects. One of the projects that we are working on is with a non-profit called the <a href="https://coastalcomputing.ca/" target="_blank">Pacific Coastal Computing Association</a> who is developing an application called <a href="https://knowledgegraph.ca/" target="_blank">KnowledgeGraph</a> to use AI to assist in educational efforts, both at UVic and other institutions, and in consultation with community efforts.
                    </p>

                        This work is also highly leveraging AWS infrastructure. Nathan Inbar is a UVic student that spent most of his summer wrangling various AWS services - EC2, S3, Application Gateway, Bedrock, ECR/ECS, etc - to create a cloud native version of KnowledgeGraph.
                    </p>

                    <p>
                        The team is using Claude Code as our AI tool of choice, and it helps to have some structure around the use of the tool to keep consistency. Even the markdown files give us a good idea of self-documenting features of using the AI tools, but the real benefit comes from allowing them to tune our working environment. We use the AI tools to plan development features, to start the development process, to do code reviews and test case development. One thing we do NOT do is vibe code. Every developer on the team is responsible for fully understanding and approving every line of code that goes into the product. How much of the code is automatically generated varies both by team member and application area.
                    </p>

                    <p>
                        Although we haven't made this shift yet, we are evaluating a tool that has just come out from Github called <a href="https://github.com/github/spec-kit" target="_blank">spec-kit</a>. As we move towards a new phase of the project in the fall we are investigating spec-kit as an AI coding model to move towards.
                    </p>

                    <p>
                        The other work presently going on is to tie the AWS services into a Terraform based setup. This is one of the areas that is always a barrier to new people on the AWS platform - understanding the wealth of services and using the web console to set them up is just a very complex learning process. The use of Terraform allows us to use an Infrastructure as Code (IaC) approach to deployment that is really important in creating repeatable installations on AWS.
                    </p>

                    <p>
                        In one exciting development, one of our team members has been asked to speak at a major Git conference at the end of the month! Congratulations Piyush in this fun opportunity!

                    <p class="lead-paragraph">
                        Mid-August of 2025, a group of UVic students participated in SIGGRAPH's <a href="https://s2025.siggraph.org/event/appy-hour/" target="_blank">Appy Hour</a>. They were demonstrating several applications that we built using Amazon Web Services to underlie the AI applications that we chose to engage audiences with. These were examples of the type of application that can support museum installations.
                    </p>

                    <p>
                        In the first example, Annie McClure built a web page and a series of speech interactive applications. She was experimenting with AI authoring tools and her first task was to figure out how to get Claude Code to work with the Anthropic models on AWS Bedrock! Fortunately, there were some guides to lead her way (<a href="https://builder.aws.com/content/2tXkZKrZzlrlu0KfH8gST5Dkppq/claude-code-on-amazon-bedrock-quick-setup-guide" target="_blank">Claude Code on Amazon Bedrock Quick Setup Guide</a>).

                    </div>

                    <p>
                        Her next task was to have Claude help her develop some web pages. A theme of the exhibit was diatoms - microscopic ocean creatures that serve an important role in ecosystem signalling. There were also two other example applications that she worked on.
                    </p>

                    </div>

                    <p>
                        These web pages were backed up by a voice interactive system that operates over the phone lines. Please call it yourself! Dr. Marino Waters (an AI) can be reached at <strong>778-817-1483</strong>.
                    </p>

                    <p>
                        Annie worked out illustrative prompts for that system, which is based on the <a href="https://aws.amazon.com/blogs/aws/introducing-amazon-nova-sonic-human-like-voice-conversations-for-generative-ai-applications/" target="_blank">AWS Nova Sonic speech to speech model</a> and allows the system to provide snappy responses that mimic human-to-human conversations. These were tied in to the telephone network through a Voice over IP service (voip.ms) and the AWS Connect service.

                        Another student, Nathan Inbar, did work to get a demonstration of the diatom application to run on the <a href="https://pro.sony/en_CA/products/spatial-reality-displays/3d-professional-images" target="_blank">Sony SRD monitor</a> which Sony loaned to us to try developing some applications on.

                        Nathan and Hongyu Wan handled the crowds at SIGGRAPH with aplomb, answering questions and demonstrating the applications. Hongyu was the primary author of the Unity-based game segment that was shown to engage visitors with the world of diatoms. Here is a video of that application!
